    <description>CrystalMorph is a 3D fractal that smoothly morphs between various shapes and configurations. A fractal's shape is defined by a set of transformations and (for a true fractal) the entire shape is repeated infinite times within it. Of course since the xbox doesn't have infinite memory, the rendering bottoms out after about 5 recursions.</description>
